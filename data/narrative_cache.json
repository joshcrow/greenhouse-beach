  "body": "Outside it's a damp 45° and the air is soup. Humidity is sitting at 90%, so the fog is sticking to the beach road. Tourists will be slamming brakes, so keep your distance if you head out. The island likes to disappear this time of year.\n\nGreenhouse is running tight. We are holding 68° inside, nice and dry compared to the dock. Systems are green with the battery at 3.31V. Just ignore the drone of those banner planes trying to sell crab legs through the mist.",
